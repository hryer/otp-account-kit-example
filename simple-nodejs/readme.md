## Facebook Account Kit Sample
Simple implementation of the Account Kit from the [FB docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/accountkit/)

### How to run the sample? 
Go through the Prerequisites [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/accountkit/webjs#prerequisites) and create your Facebook Developer Account, get the Facebook App ID (create the app) and then choose the app settings. 

For this sample to work, you will need the *app id*, *account kit version* and the *app secret*. These values can be found on your app dashboard. Once you get the values, copy/paste them to ```fb_config.js``` file and run ```npm start``` to launch the sample.
